### Basic fishingrod

2. Attach rod to the hook by simply touching them together. Attach bait by touching the hook.
3. Make sure your hook is inside the water, it may take up to 30 seconds to catch something.
4. Detach your catch by either pressing E on it or walking over it.

Any catched props can be sold using R key. There's a small chance of catching anything from "Items" menu too.
