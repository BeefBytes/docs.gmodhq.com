# Global Rules

!!! note
    Rules may change and evolve as times goes by. We're open to community suggestions! 


!!! warning
    Keep in mind ALL of the punishments are recorded and displayed on your profile for public to see. 
    Players with excessive amount of punishments:
- Will stop receiving weekly rewards
- Will never be accepted as a staff member
- Will less likely to be trusted by other players



## Use common sense
Our goal is not to bury players with a ton of rules they are forced to read. 
If rule isn't listed in certain way, it doesn't mean you get a pass. 
If you're uncertain about rule(s), contact a staff member.

## Use /report
If you need staff assistance or see someone breaking rules, the fastest method of contacting staff is by using /report. 
Reports are displayed on a web page for all of the staff members. Meaning, even offline staff will be able to see your message.

## No racism
Racism is not tolerated.

## Be respectful
Being disrespectful will never lead to anything positive. If you're frustrated at a staff member or another player breaking rules. 
Use /report, don't try to handle situation yourself. We reward players for being respectful and helpful.

## No threats and/or evil intent
Any threats or intent to harm other players or the community will result in a punishment. Don't joke about DDoS, hacking or anything related. 
You will be punished even if you're joking around. It would be unproductive for staff to figure out if player was joking or not. 

## No cheating
Using cheats, hacks or abusing glitches will not be tolerated. If you found a bug, report it and you may receive rewards depending on bug's severity.
