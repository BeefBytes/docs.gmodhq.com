# DarkRP Rules

We have a different approach to the rules. 
We're way less strict than other the servers, 
majority of the rules listed below are explanations for why it isn't a rule.


## No adverts for raids, mugs, hits and other RP actions

Why should a player ever announce their actions to anyone other than the players directly involved?
The only possible reason is logging the action for admins. After all, when someone complains, the admins can check the logs for an advert.
If there was no advert, people get warned, if there was, some  rooftop is called in.
The problem is that players now complain about people not advertising an otherwise perfectly valid RP action.
People are not necessarily punished for bad RP, but merely forgetting to log their every single move. That's terrible.

There are two solutions: scripts logging things automatically is the first. 
For things that cannot be logged automatically players can complain using /report. 
Focusing on catching players red handed is way more efficient than going off logged chat.

## No traditional FailRP
FailRP has become a way for players to force admins to resolve disputes that would otherwise stay in-character. 
Example: a gun dealer steals a shipment from a fellow gundealer. The victim gundealer calls FailRP because only thieves or gangsters are allowed to steal. 
The thieving gundealer, however had a valid RP reason for stealing those shipments: stolen shipments have a bigger profit margin than bought shipments. 
Not only that, it hurts competition!

FailRP demands this gundealer to do only precisely that which the job description in the F4 menu describes. Any step out of line can be considered FailRP. 
People should solve such disputes with the resources that they have. The victim gundealer, for example, could take revenge, better secure their shipments or otherwise be creative in finding a solution.
